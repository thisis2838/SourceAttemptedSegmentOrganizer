Source Demo Manager is an utility that aims to organize attempted save and demo files when doing segments for Segmented Run.

## How it Works
Upon requested, the tool will seek out demo and save files for an attempted segment that the runner might want to keep. They are moved into a Work Folder for storage and is cataloged in the Demo List

If the runner is satisfied with one or more saved segments, they can Process them, which will rename the files according to a customizable naming scheme, and move them to a Final Folder for upload.

At any time, the runner can remove segments from either the Work Folder or the Final Folder.

## Support
At this time, only demos usable in Yalter's Listdemo can be opened.
